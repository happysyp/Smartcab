# Train a Smartcab to Drive
Reinforcement learning techniques was employed to construct a smartcab operating in real-time to achieve both safety and efficiency.

In this project, an optimized Q-Learning driving agent was constructed to navigate a Smartcab through its environment towards a goal. Since the Smartcab was expected to drive passengers from one location to another, the driving agent was evaluated on two very important metrics: Safety and Reliability. A driving agent that gets the Smartcab to its destination while running red lights or narrowly avoiding accidents would be considered unsafe. Similarly, a driving agent that frequently fails to reach the destination in time would be considered unreliable. Maximizing the driving agent's safety and reliability would ensure that Smartcabs have a permanent place in the transportation industry.
